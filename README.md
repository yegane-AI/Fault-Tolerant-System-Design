# Fault-Tolerant-System-Design
In this repository, I'll add the codes and programs I wrote whether as assignments or exams for the fault-tolerant system design. 

Two directories are a Manchester Carry Chain Adder and a Normal Adder, with and without an Inverter, written in Hspice. I used feature sizes of 45nm and 90 nm. 
The picture Voltage-Configuration shows my defined voltages. I used a frequency of 100 MHz. The picture Final-Result shows the power consumption of these two adders with 45 and 90 nm technologies.  

Directories cordic_vhdl and sqrt are square root computation using cordic algorithms with VHDL and Verilog, respectively. 
I calculated the power consumption of the VHDL program with five different FPGA families: Artix7, Kintex7, Spartan6, Virtex7, and Zynq. Pictures regarding their power consumption are also available based on their names.

The DVS evaluation on Gray and Normal Adder directory evaluates the DVS effect on 4-bit Gray and Normal Adders.
